Hi there. My name is Yuchen.
I am a software engineer.

I am currently working on the infrastructure team at Meta,
where I build capacity management tooling.
I worked on both physical capacity management (similar to AWS EC2)
and virtual capacity management (such as Async, Manifold, etc.).
Both are NP-hard problems at the core that require a lot of thought and care.

Previously, I worked at Hopper building a product for selling flights, hotels, and various ancillaries. We use Scala, Kafka, HBase, Spanner, Airflow, etc. I also spent a big chunk of my time building mobile apps. Check out our app on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/hopper-flights-hotels-cars/id904052407) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hopper.mountainview.play&hl=en_CA&gl=US)!

I was born and raised in China and now living in Canada.
Outside work,
I play chess (both Chinese and international chess), badminton, table tennis.
I go bouldering and skating occasionally. I play guitar but am still a beginner.
After Covid, I also start to go fishing during summer.
Aside from those, I also write technical blogs on [Medium](https://medium.com/@yuchen52), follow me there!
